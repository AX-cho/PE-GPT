This ensures that the design is not only theoretically sound but also practically viable, aligning closely with real-world performance.

(4) Supporting Iterative Design and Customization

    Responsive to Feedback: Throughout the design process, PE-GPT interacts with users to refine and adjust the design based on feedback. For example, if a suggested modulation strategy does not fully meet the userâ€™s requirements, the model can propose alternatives and fine-tune the parameters accordingly.
    Customizable Workflows: PE-GPT supports multiple design workflows, allowing users to select the most relevant approach for their specific task. Whether it's optimizing a new design, verifying it through simulations, or fine-tuning it based on real-world data, PE-GPT adapts to the needs of the project.

(5) Enhancing Design Consistency and Reducing Errors

    Consistency in Outputs: By leveraging the structured knowledge and integrated tools within its framework, PE-GPT ensures that design outputs are consistent across iterations. This reduces the risk of errors and enhances the reliability of the final product.
    Reduction of Hallucinations: Through the use of domain-specific knowledge and the RAG technique, PE-GPT minimizes the occurrence of incorrect or irrelevant outputs, a common issue in general-purpose LLMs.

    Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG): One of the core innovations of PE-GPT is the integration of a PE-specific knowledge base using RAG. This allows the model to pull in specialized information that is crucial for accurate and relevant decision-making in PE design. Traditional LLMs trained on general corpora lack the depth required for such specific tasks, but PE-GPT fills this gap by using a curated knowledge base to provide expert-level insights.
    Enhanced Design Accuracy: The model's ability to access and utilize PE-specific knowledge significantly improves the accuracy of its outputs. For example, in the case studies demonstrated, PE-GPT showed a 22.2% increase in correctness over human experts, proving its superior capability in handling complex PE design tasks.
